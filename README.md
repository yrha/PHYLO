=====
Aligning genomic data is a fundamental but difficult (NP-hard) problem in Biology. We developed Phylo, a casual video game which solutions are used to compare genomes.  In this project, we implemented a complete gaming framework and an API for human-computing video games in genomics.  <b>Come help solve science through playing games!</b>
