Note
=====
This folder is used to contain all the neccessary scripts to build the RNA version<br>
If the features or dependancies under js/DNA does not fit for this part.  Either write an extension or create a new module, do not modify the files in js/DNA. Files under js/DNA are the base of the framework<br>
Remeber if need to add a new file, please add it in index.html

Naming Schema
=====
if its an extension - \<module name\>.ext.\<file extension\> <br>
- eg: sequence.ext.js ,  this will tell us you are extending the prototype from sequence.core.js from js/DNA

if its a new module - \<module name\>.\<core | theme ... etc\>.\<file extension\> <br>
- eg: color.theme.js  ,  this will tell us you defined a new module and its for theming.

Crash Course Material
=====
I'll put some js crash course material soon~
